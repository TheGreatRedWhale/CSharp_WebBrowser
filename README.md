# CSharp_WebBrowser
This was my course project for CPSC 2710 at Auburn University. Part of that course required the use
of older codebases, so please forgive any deprecated elements. As always, my code is clean, efficient,
and highly scalable. If you've stumbled on this page, you're likely a recruiter, so please contact me
with any questions.
